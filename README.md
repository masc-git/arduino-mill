This could be a replacement for the control PCB of a Tunturi Platinum Treadmill 11PTTR1000 1.8kW, maybe for other models too. the inverter PCB and the base PCB are still working, but the microcontroller fujitsu MB95F118NS seams dead. also the video-controller weltrend WT8881A doesn't drive the display. we did a reverse engineering of the connection between the top and base PCB to control the treadmill with a arduino.
